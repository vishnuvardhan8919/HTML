      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        The 2023 <mark>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</mark> is clear in its intentions: it is uncompromisingly designed for maximum performance. The 518 hp road-legal high-performance sports car takes full advantage of technology and concepts from motorsport. Even beyond the high-revving naturally aspirated engine with racing DNA and intelligent lightweight construction, it is, above all, the cooling and aerodynamic systems of the 911 GT3 RS that connect it most directly with its motorsport brother, the 911 GT3 R.

      <h2>Downforce Update</h2>
      <p>
        The new 911 GT3 RS is set up for performance – thanks to increased downforce and revised aerodynamics. Using all vehicle data, including longitudinal/lateral acceleration, accelerator/brake pedal position and friction values, even the position of the rear wing and front diffuser are automatically adjusted to the driving situation in split seconds by Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) with DRS. Best prerequisites for the next flying lap.The new aero wishbones on the front axle increase downforce by reducing turbulence and the flow rate behind the bars – by up to 88 lbs at top speed. Sophisticated technology, derived from motorsports.

      <h2>Thrilling Lightness</h2>
      <p>
        The highest maxim in lightweight construction: Reduce to the maximum. The new 911 GT3 RS also remains true to this motorsport philosophy – despite the significantly expanded and further improved equipment compared to its predecessors, including the active aerodynamics, wider wheels and tires, wider body and more extensive adjustment options for the chassis in different driving modes.The consistent use of <u>carbon fiber reinforced plastic</u> (CFRP) enables a curb weight of just 3268 lbs. The fenders, front lid in a specific RS shape and roof are all made of motorsport-tested materials. The CFRP rear wing with active aerodynamics, CFRP doors for optimized wheel arch vents, and aluminum and magnesium lightweight forged wheels also yield significant advantages on the race track.

      <h2>Maximum Performance</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as the lights give the starting signal, the new 911 GT3 RS delivers unbelievable performance of up to 342 lb-ft on the racetrack. With up to 518 hp, taking you from 0-60 mph in 3.0 seconds, it can reach a top track speed of 184 mph. The lightweight stainless steel sport exhaust system ensures an unfiltered sound experience up to a maximum of 9,000 rpm.Modern motorsport technology sets the tone in the 4.0-liter high revving naturally aspirated engine: 4-valve technology including rocker arms and rigid valve drive, as well as forged pistons and titanium connecting rods. The oil supply is optimized and ready for high lateral forces, thanks to dry sump lubrication with a separate engine oil tank.

      <h2>High-revving four liter six-cylinder boxer engine</h2>
      <p>
        The 4.0-liter high-revving naturally aspirated engine has been further optimized compared with the 911 GT3. The increase in power to 518 hp (911 GT3 – 502 hp) is achieved primarily via new camshafts with modified cam profiles. The single-throttle intake system and the rigid valvetrain are derived from motorsport. Like the 911 GT3, this engine also has six individual throttle bodies; one per cylinder. The seven-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) has a shorter overall gear ratio than the 911 GT3 and is aided by air intakes on the underbody to ensure that the transmission can withstand even extreme loads during frequent use on track.
